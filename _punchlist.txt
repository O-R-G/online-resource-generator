+ make the height responsive to the content 
  > changed to custom because real-time updating of canvas size is too complex
+ change the shape option 'square' to 'fill' so that it fills the whole canvas
x add a dropdown for text block positions
  > micro adjustment for text block positions should be enough
+ micro adjustment for text block positions
+ logo (maybe as an 'upload' of watermark fields?)
  > implement custom shape to static/js/src/custom/
+ moved the old upload to be an option of shape
+ added upload 
+ rotation
+ text alignment for watermark
+ fix watermark positioning (likely related to canvas.scale)
x add textbox position dropdown
+ arrow keys to adjust position value
+ hide dropdowns with only one option
+ apply white brackets to word-level
+ canvasAnimated
+ saving for stories not working as expected (sophia, 23 sep 2024 email)
+ watermarks are distorted when there are two shapes
+ resolution custom field should match download file size
+ sort out workflows related to the canvas resolution
+ new animation: fade-in, fade-out
- add to animated shape
  + font dropdown
  - media fields
+ make media fields savable
+ update default config files
+ frame is weird when the shape is square at first, then change of 
  canvas, then change of shape.
+ when generate from existing open record with custom image preview does 
  not respect scale, x, or y. if you change any of these values, then 
  preview updates
+ the update of back typography/font is behind by one step
+ the value of shape position is not consistent with others
+ arrow keys doesn't work for main text shift fields
+ add fallback when the number fields don't receive a number
+ sync fields
  + font
  + shape shift
+ from static to animated canvas. everything becomes half the size on retina screen.
+ text shift of animated and static shapes are inconsistent on retina screen
  + main text
  + watermarks
+ on static canvas, main text shift and some typography settings affects watermarks
+ custom canvas size doesn't work for three canvas
+ square doesn't work when switch to animated from static
+ rest-front makes the browser super slow
+ fade in/out watermarks
+ add exceptions to initDownloadGif() to handle the delay of fadeIn and fadeOut
+ save static canvas as pdf
  + consider pdf size proportion when saving canvas as a pdf
  + resize text and images
+ make watermark positions relative to shape area, especially when the canvas is not square
+ adjust y-position of triangle when the size is different.
+ shapeCenter is not synced correctly when the canvas size is not default
x gif is way slower than mp4
  it only slows down when viewed with mac preview
+ gif filename
x clean up setCanvasSize for three.js canvas
x unify text-handling (main texts and watermarks)
- italic style for animated shapes
+ shape "angoli" for animated shapes
+ custom base image can not be saved
- update old database: media-1-shift-x => static-shape-0-field-id-media-1-shift-x
+ make sure the key of base in the saved records is a word instead of a hex code
+ pdf generation is not working
+ update the text of the "Choose file" button when a file has been selected
+ make media work for the animated canvas
+ wrong watermark position for animated angolo
+ weird white edge of animated angolo
+ sync media
  + shape color media can't be synced because applyImageAsMaterial() is called before draw() so the geometry is a BufferGeometry. 
  + sync media values (shift-x, shift-y, etc.)
+ the watermark placement changes also on teiger when you switch to animated threejs canvas.
- when the input is cleaned, rotate doesnt update
+ scale, x, and y of media doesn't work after saving
+ media-removing button removes all the custom media fields
+ apply the updates on the media fields to the animated shape and canvas.
+ handle base image and shape image in the prop media if the base is switched to a solid color better
- three js mix blend mode for images
+ gradient doesn't work for base
- when updated, make sure the triangle corner radius is half of the previous value
+ angolo corner doesn't show up when the shape color is an image on animated shapes
+ saved text doesnt show up
+ mobile css
+ when the animation is rest and background is custom image, the text on the right disappears (likely a z-index issue). e.g., 2024/alex-sloane/alex-sloane-spotlight
+ surrounding watermarks look weird on static shapes.
+ video is not sync correctly, both position and file loading
