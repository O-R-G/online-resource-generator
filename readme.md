O-R-G inc. 
Last updated 30 JULY 2025

### INSTRUCTIONS

Your new website includes custom software to produce static <!--and animated --> graphic resources for social media. You can easily create and modify these using ONLINE-RESOURCE-GENERATOR, a light-weight web interface to a robust graphic generation system. You can access the interface at the following URL:

https://castellodirivoli.o-r-g.net/online-resource-generator/

To login, use the following account (User Name) and the corresponding credential (Password).

	main  : add, and edit resources

You are now connected to the resource generator. 

### NEW . . .

Choose “Format” to begin. Options correspond to current standard social media formats. <!-- This applies to both static and animated graphics.--> From here, you can choose “Base” to set the background, “Shape” to select the form, and “Color.” <!--“Animation”  set to any option except “None” will produce an animated graphic. --> “Text” includes a field for the primary text, typography sizing, and alignment options. The text position can be changed via the X and Y fields, or via the arrow keys on your keyboard when the cursor is in either the X or Y field. The “Text” field can be of any length and may include line returns. “Add text” appends additional text fields to the resource. “Add media” appends additional media.

### SAVE . . .

All resources can be saved. Before generating a resource, it is advised to save. Any saved resource can be modified in the future. The saved resource is stored as a record in a database managed by OPEN RECORDS GENERATOR. The new record will be named by the contents of the “Text” field. If the “Text” field is blank, the record will be named with the current date and time. All saved records can be viewed and edited at the following URL:

https://castellodirivoli.o-r-g.net/open-records-generator

To login, use the following account (User Name) and the corresponding credential (Password).

	main  : add, and edit resources

### SHARE . . .

ONLINE-RESOURCE-GENERATOR allows you to share and modify resources between users. Clicking “Share” copies a unique URL to your clipboard which may be sent to another user via email, txt, etc. This URL remains canonical (consistent) and so the same shared link can continue to be used to make changes to the resource.

### GENERATE . . .

When the resource is complete, click “↓ png” <!-- or ↓ mp4 --> to download a final sized graphic resource in .png <!-- or .mp4 --> format.

A typical workflow combines these functions.
