# ONLINE RESOURCE GENERATOR
Version 1.0
O-R-G inc.  
Last updated 15 AUGUST 2024

## INSTRUCTIONS

Your new website includes custom software to produce static and animated graphic assets. You can easily create and modify these by using ONLINE-RESOURCE-GENERATOR, a light-weight web interface to a robust graphic generation system. You can access this interface by entering the following URL:

http://teigerfoundation.org/online-resource-generator/

To login, use the following account (User Name) and the corresponding credential (Password).

	main  : add, and edit resources

You are now connected to the asset generator and ready to create a new graphic resource. 

### NEW . . .

Choose “Format” to begin. There are currently two options, “Post” and “Story” which correspond to square and vertical formats. This applies to both static and animated graphics. From here, you can choose “Base” to set the background, “Shape” to select the form, and “Color.” “Animation”  set to any option except “None” will produce an animated graphic. “Text” includes a field for the primary text, typography sizing, and alignment options. The text position can be changed via the X and Y fields, or via the arrow keys on your keyboard. The “Text” field can be of any length and may include line returns. “Add a watermark” appends additional text fields to the graphic. There is no limit in number or length on these fields.

### SAVE . . .

All resources can be saved in OPEN RECORDS GENERATOR. Before generating an object, it is advised to save. Any saved object can be modified in the future. The saved record will be named by the contents of the “Text” field.

### SHARE . . .

ONLINE-RESOURCE-GENERATOR allows you to share and modify assets between users. Clicking “Share” copies a unique url to your clipboard which may be sent to another user via email, txt, etc. This url remains canonical (consistent) and so the same shared link can continue to be used to make changes to the asset.

### GENERATE . . .

When the graphic is complete, click “Generate” to produce a final graphic asset as .jpg or .mp4 format.

### NEW (FROM COPY)

It can be useful to use an existing graphic asset as a template for creating another similar graphic. If the new graphic is the same as the previous with text or color changes, this can be a useful strategy. In other cases, it is typically best to start from scratch as the asset building process is quick and easy.
